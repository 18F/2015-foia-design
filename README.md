## foia-portal

A user-facing portal for issuing FOI requests.

The tentative plan for this repo is a static (HTML/CSS/JS) website whose first pass is to contain -

* An interface for submitting a FOIA request, through [foia-core](https://github.com/18f/foia-core).
* Low-fidelity (is it open or closed?) status checking for individual requests, also using [foia-core](https://github.com/18f/foia-core).

[foia-core](https://github.com/18f/foia-core) is where the actual service will reside that handles the request, and manages agency interaction.
