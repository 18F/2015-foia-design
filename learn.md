**What is FOIA?**

Since 1966, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has granted the public the right to obtain access to almost any agency record. Under FOIA, agencies are required to disclose any information requested unless it falls under a specific set of [exemptions](http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exemptions) or [exclusions](http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exclusions).

This public right has been maintained for decades and has served as the backbone for information disclosures. This has led to the publication of many important news stories and greater public awareness around government activities.

**Why would I make a FOIA request?**

While the Federal Government makes a lot of information [available](data.gov) in [many](search.usa.gov) [places](http://foia.state.gov/Search/Search.aspx), you may still have some questions about information that is important to you. The public has the right to access most of the information the Federal Government maintains and FOIA makes it possible to access things that are not yet available widely.

**What can I ask for?**

FOIA requests can be made for any "agency record." This is a broad term that covers things like books, papers, maps, photographs, emails, machine-readable materials, and other documentary materials. You can specify whether you'd like to receive these materials in electronic or paper formats as well.â€¨

**Is there a special form I have to use to make a FOIA request?**

There is no specific form that must be used to make a request. All you need is to write a reasonable description of the information you'd like and comply with any agency-specific requirements.

While this is all that is required, agencies often need direction on how best to fulfill the request. Things like time periods, specific officials, or key words related to the information you are seeking will help inform the agency.

**How do I make a FOIA request?**

Requests must be written, electronically or in paper format, and should include a reasonable description of the information you want and the format you want it in.

The FOIA does not require agencies to do research for you, analyze data, answer written questions, or create records in response to your request.

**What happens after I make my FOIA request?**

A lot happens behind the scenes after an agency receives your FOIA request. Agencies tend to have their own specific way of handling a request and will search for the records. Once they've located the records, the agency will go through a process where subject matter experts, lawyers, or other officials will review and redact (black out) any information that is exempt from disclosure.

Once the agency has completed this process, the records that are able to be will be released to you.

**How long does it take to fulfill my request?**

Response time varies between agencies, but also depends on the complexity of the request. The standard time limit established by FOIA is approximately one month, but some requests are inherently more complex and will require more time.

If an agency gets an extension, it will notify you. During this time, the agency will provide you with an opportunity to modify the scope of the request to help improve the response time.

Another option is to agree to a different timetable for processing the request. Agency websites and the agency's FOIA Public Liaison will have more information on this process.

**What happens if I'm not satisfied with the response I received?**

If necessary, you may appeal the initial decision made on your request. All you have to do is send a letter to the agency stating as much. The appeal is reviewed independently and you will be informed of the decision made.

Sometimes an appeal isn't the best route. Try contacting the agency that handled the request or reach out to their FOIA Public Liaison, who is there to help you throughout this process and help resolve any disputes.

If the appeal process is complete and you are not yet satisfied, you can also seek mediation services from the [Office of Government Information Services](https://ogis.archives.gov/) at the National Archives and Records Administration.
