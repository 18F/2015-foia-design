<h2>The Freedom of Information Act</h2>

<p>
  Get started requesting information under the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>

<section class="agency">
  <p>
    If you know the agency you want to request records from, start typing it below. Once you've located an agency, you can bookmark the page to return there any time.
  </p>

  <form class="agency pure-form" method="get" action="agency.html">
    <input type="search" class="agency" name="agency" placeholder="Start typing the name of an agency..." value="General Services Administration" />
  </form>
</section>

<section class="request">

<p>
  You can make your FOIA request to the General Services Administration right from here.
</p>

<p>
  Please bear in mind:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to include your name and contact information to file a request.</li>
  <li>FOIA requests are themselves public records, so do not include any unnecessary personal information.</li>
  <li>You can only request records that already exist.</li>
  <li>You may be contacted by a FOIA processing officer to help target and narrow your request to something they can fulfill.</li>
</ul>
